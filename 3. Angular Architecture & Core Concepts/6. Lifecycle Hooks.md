# Lifecycle Hooks in Angular

Angular components and directives go through a series of phases from their creation to their destruction. These phases are known as **lifecycle hooks**, and Angular provides built-in methods that allow developers to execute logic at different stages of a component’s or directive's life.

## List of Lifecycle Hooks

1. **ngOnChanges()**
2. **ngOnInit()**
3. **ngDoCheck()**
4. **ngAfterContentInit()**
5. **ngAfterContentChecked()**
6. **ngAfterViewInit()**
7. **ngAfterViewChecked()**
8. **ngOnDestroy()**

## Lifecycle Hooks for Components and Directives

| Hook | Component | Directive | When It’s Called | Use Case |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **ngOnChanges** | ✅ | ✅ | Before `ngOnInit()`, and whenever an `@Input()` property changes. | React to changes in input-bound properties. |
| **ngOnInit** | ✅ | ✅ | Once after the component or directive is initialized. | Fetch data, initialize logic. |
| **ngDoCheck** | ✅ | ✅ | During every change detection cycle. | Custom change detection logic. |
| **ngAfterContentInit** | ✅ | ✅ | After content (such as `ng-content`) is projected into the component. | Execute logic once projected content is initialized. |
| **ngAfterContentChecked** | ✅ | ✅ | After projected content is checked in the change detection cycle. | Respond to projected content changes. |
| **ngAfterViewInit** | ✅ | ❌ | After component’s view and child views are initialized. | DOM manipulations after view is rendered. |
| **ngAfterViewChecked** | ✅ | ❌ | After the component’s view is checked in the change detection cycle. | Execute logic when the component’s view updates. |
| **ngOnDestroy** | ✅ | ✅ | Just before the component or directive is destroyed. | Clean up subscriptions, remove event listeners, free resources. |

## Lifecycle Hooks for Components

### 1. ngOnChanges()
- **When it’s called:** Before `ngOnInit()`, and whenever an `@Input()` property changes.
- **Use case:** To react to changes in input-bound properties.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    console.log('Input property changed:', changes);
  }
  ```

### 2. ngOnInit()
- **When it’s called:** Once after the component is initialized.
- **Use case:** Ideal for fetching data and initializing component logic.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Component initialized');
  }
  ```

### 3. ngDoCheck()
- **When it’s called:** During every change detection cycle.
- **Use case:** For custom change detection logic.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngDoCheck() {
    console.log('Change detection triggered');
  }
  ```

### 4. ngAfterContentInit()
- **When it’s called:** After content (such as `ng-content`) is projected into the component.
- **Use case:** To execute logic once projected content is initialized.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log('Projected content initialized');
  }
  ```

### 5. ngAfterContentChecked()
- **When it’s called:** After projected content is checked in the change detection cycle.
- **Use case:** To respond to projected content changes.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngAfterContentChecked() {
    console.log('Projected content checked');
  }
  ```

### 6. ngAfterViewInit()
- **When it’s called:** After component’s view and child views are initialized.
- **Use case:** For DOM manipulations after the view is rendered.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log('View initialized');
  }
  ```

### 7. ngAfterViewChecked()
- **When it’s called:** After the component’s view is checked in the change detection cycle.
- **Use case:** To execute logic when the component’s view updates.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngAfterViewChecked() {
    console.log('View checked');
  }
  ```

### 8. ngOnDestroy()
- **When it’s called:** Just before the component is destroyed.
- **Use case:** To clean up subscriptions, remove event listeners, and free resources.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('Component destroyed');
  }
  ```

## Lifecycle Hooks for Directives
Directives share many of the same lifecycle hooks as components, with some differences in their usage.

### Example Directive Lifecycle Hook Usage:
```typescript
@Directive({ selector: '[appHighlight]' })
export class HighlightDirective implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
    console.log('Directive initialized');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('Directive destroyed');
  }
}
```

## Lifecycle Flow Order
1. **ngOnChanges()** → Only if `@Input()` properties change
2. **ngOnInit()**
3. **ngDoCheck()**
4. **ngAfterContentInit()**
5. **ngAfterContentChecked()**
6. **ngAfterViewInit()**
7. **ngAfterViewChecked()**
8. **(Repeat ngDoCheck, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewChecked on every change detection cycle)**
9. **ngOnDestroy()**

## Best Practices
✅ Use `ngOnInit()` for initialization logic instead of the constructor.
✅ Use `ngOnDestroy()` to clean up observables and event listeners.
✅ Avoid heavy computations inside lifecycle hooks like `ngDoCheck()` and `ngAfterViewChecked()`.
✅ Use `ngOnChanges()` to efficiently handle input changes.
